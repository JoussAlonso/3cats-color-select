This is a color picker dialog you can use in your apps.
You are probably surprised that you didn't find a color selection dialog in the Android SDK. Me too.

I wrote this after using the "Ambil Warna" library by Yuku, hosted here but I was unable to fix a few bugs related to layouts. Thanks to Yuku for his work, the library not only it helped me in my apps but also was my tutorial to libraries, dialogs and basic graphics in Android!

This dialog is a HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) model color pallete that supports Android 1.5 and 1.6 forward, portrait and landscape for small to xlarge screens.

Just check out in Eclipse and use according to the Quick Start Guide on the Wiki.
